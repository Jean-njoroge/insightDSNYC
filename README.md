## TOPIC MODELING IN PATENT DOCUMENT

> You should be innovating so fast that you're invalidating your prior patents - Elon Musk*

This repository includes information on projects completed during my insight data science fellowship. An  intensive 7-week post-doctoral training fellowship bridging the gap between academia &Â data science. 

For my data science project, I used publicly available data from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to automatic parse patent documents, extracting topical information and theme changes over time. The code and notebooks are presented in this repo.

### Overview:

The analysis is divided into four sections, saved in juypter notebooks in this repository
1. Identifying the problem  and Data Sources
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Pre-Processing the Data
4. Build model to predict whether breast cell tissue is  malignant or Benign
