> You should be innovating so fast that you're invalidating your prior patents - Elon Musk*

This repository includes information on projects completed during my insight data science fellowship. An  intensive 7-week post-doctoral training fellowship bridging the gap between academia &Â data science. 

For my data science project, I used publicly available data from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to automatic parse patent documents, extracting topical information and theme changes over time. The code and notebooks are presented in this repo [more information can be found on here]

### Overview:

The analysis is divided into four sections, saved in juypter notebooks in this repository
1. Identifying the problem scope and Data Sources
2. Text/Data Preprocessing
3. Model Training and Evaluation
4. Visualization. 

Notebook 1:  Identifying problem scope and Getting data.

Notebook goal:Identify the types of information contained in our data set in this notebook
