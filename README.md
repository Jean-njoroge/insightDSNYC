This repository includes information on projects completed during my insight data science fellowship. An  intensive 7-week post-doctoral training fellowship bridging the gap between academia &Â data science. For my data science project, I used publicly available data from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to automatic parse patent documents, extracting topical information and theme changes over time. The code and notebooks are presented in this repo.

## TOPIC MODELING IN PATENT DOCUMENT



### Overview:

The repository is  to:
* Apply the fundamental concepts of machine learning from an available dataset
* Evaluate and interpret my results and justify my interpretation based on observed data set
* Create notebooks that serve as computational records and document my thought process. t
